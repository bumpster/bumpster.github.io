## About the Project
Our software will generate bump and physically based rendering maps using a specifically trained neural network. It will be able to identify the topological properties of the surface, as well as the material properties using a single photograph. Our product will be the used in the server to make the required operations, and communicate with the front-end applications on various platforms. We believe our software will provide rather large benefits for the industry, as the previous solution to this kind of topographical analysis required expensive methods which require personnel   with expertise, expensive equipment, and time.
